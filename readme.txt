BLSTM
  The morphology reconstruction (tracing) of neurons in 3D microscopy images is important to neuron science research. However, this task remains very challenging because of the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the discontinued segments of neurite patterns in the images. In this paper, we present a neuronal structure segmentation method based on the ray-shooting model and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network to enhance the weak-signal neuronal structures and remove background noise in 3D neuron microscopy images. Specifically,the ray-shooting model is used to extract the intensity distribution features within a local region of the image. And we design a neural network based on the dual channel bidirectional LSTM (DC-BLSTM) to detect the foreground voxels according to the voxel-intensity features and boundary-response features extracted by multiple ray-shooting models that are generated in the whole image. This way, we transform the 3D image segmentation task into multiple 1D ray/sequence segmentation tasks, which makes it much easier to label the training samples than many existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based 3D neuron image segmentation methods.
